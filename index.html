  <h1>KIRON ANG</h1>
  <h2>June 18, 2025</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is "Kiron", pronounced with a hard "K", an "I" sound like
    in "eye", and an ending that rhymes with "lawn". I'm currently an
    undergraduate student at Baylor University, although I plan to
    graduate soon; In fact, I will graduate in December 2025 with a
    Bachelors of Science in Informatics!
