  <h1>KIRON ANG</h1>
  <h2>June 18, 2025</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! This is my accessible website, where anyone can learn more about
    me! My name is "Kiron", pronounced with a hard "K", an "I" sound like
    in "eye", and an ending that rhymes with "lawn". I'm currently an
    undergraduate student at Baylor University, although I plan to
    graduate soon; In fact, I'll graduate in December 2025 with a
    Bachelors of Science in Informatics!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll post my class schedule once the semester begins, but for now, I
    plan on adding some of my photography. This way, people can visually
    learn about both my life and my abilities with a Digital SLR camera.
    Of course, all images will have text descriptions, ensuring that this
    website remains accessible to everyone. If you want to contact me,
    please send me an email at kiron_ang1@baylor.edu! I love emails!
  </p>
