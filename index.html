  <h1>KIRON ANG</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Kiron, with a hard "K", an "I" sound like in "eye", and a "ron" sound that rhymes with "lawn". I'm currently an undergraduate student at Baylor University, although I plan to graduate soon; In fact, I will graduate in December 2025 with a Bachelors of Science in Informatics!</p>
